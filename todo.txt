reasoning on using acgan discriminator as classifier. gan says final discriminator is bad but thats ok
inter-rater reliability. I guess i'll just try cohens kappa or fleis kappa but just pick the ones that have overlap between annotators
should i work on word level predictions model?
data stastics to include, liek AMT stats
add random noise to each time step or to the first time step in the generator (maybe instead of categorical sampling in output layer?)
need reasoning for why we didn't include a class embedding c for the generator. why we instead included c as controlling the softmax output
number of test sentences in each fold
discriminator can tell so easily because fake examples are not as sparse as real examples
in generator, upon reaching a </s>, make the rest of the sentence be padding
